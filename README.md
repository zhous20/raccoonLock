Capstone project
Intro: a device that will keep raccoons away from the trash binThe device will include sensors, control systems, mechanical design, and software-hardware interfacing. It is able to differentiate humans from raccoons, then alert raccoons by making sound, light, and vibrations. The system will also be capable of keeping several kinds of animals away other than raccoons, for example, squirrels, skunks, etc. The deviceâ€™s deterrence features shall not harm animals physically, nor become a significant nuisance to people around. 

Due to some reasons it's hard to upload whole project here with both hardware components and software components. Please check the url of demo video for reference.
